## Web UI jPackage

This package will provide javascript classes for creating web UI Elements (aka Forms). 
Its provided in jPackage packages (see https://github.com/beruns/jPackage)

At the moment, this is mainly a demonstration for the use of jPackage.
The Package itself is pretty much in pre alpha state (it doesn't actually do anything except show some intentions ;) )
